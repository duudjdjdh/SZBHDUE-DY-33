## About
NettleWeb is a free, open-source unblocked online community platform that allows users to chat, watch videos and share games. Its goal is to bring every internet user an unrestricted and private environment, because we believe that it is incorrect to steal user data without their proper consent, and everyone deserves the right to do whatever they want.

NettleWeb is, and will always be, free and open-source. You can however show us your care by giving a star or contributing to this project (see the contributing section below for details). It will significantly improve the project's future development.

## Features
- **Chat** - Server/DM/Groups/AI Chat
- **Games** - 5000+, HTML5/Flash/DOS
- **Videos** - Unblocked YouTube/SoundCloud
- **Emulators/Apps** - Proxy, game emulators, PC emulators
- **Simple UI design** - No bloaty features, everything runs smoothly on low RAM devices

## Mirror Links
We are no longer maintaining any mirror links, because listed links could be blocked very easily. Please consider using data URL for bypassing browser extensions, or self-host a mirror link for bypassing external network restrictions. (See below for instructions)

## Self Hosting
If the main link is not working properly, you could self-host your own mirror link by following the instructions below.

Note: If you are seeing a 'disconnected' message in the header of your self-hosted mirror website, it means that the default backend server has been restricted. Games will be able to play as normal, but you would not be able to access certain features such as chat, proxy, game comments. In this case, using a backend mirror could help. For detailed instructions, please checkout [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qh4VDIIYyi37f4nYaUqEiYd-CbI7dN6Bsaoy0X4hsQ0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5hlrywvf3ho5).

#### GitHub Pages
1. Click on the fork button at the top right corner to fork this repository.
2. Rename it to `username.github.io` where `username` is your actual GitHub username.
3. In your forked repository, go to settings->pages. Change 'source' to 'GitHub Actions' and click save.
4. Your forked mirror version should now be published at the URL shown above. Deploying the contents usually takes 10 minutes, so it is normal to see a blank page if you opened the link too early. If GitHub Pages is blocked for you, switching to an alternative hosting provider listed below may help.

Note 1: Due to resource linkage, hosting the website at non-root locations like `username.github.io/project` is **not supported** at this moment. If you already have a project hosted at the root location, consider using a custom domain or creating another GitHub account.

Note 2: Always update your mirror website whenever a new version is released. Using an outdated version might prevent you from connecting after a protocol change.

## Data URL
The code below is a data URL of an embedded NettleWeb mirror, it can bypass most browser extensions on Chrome and Edge. However it **cannot** be used to bypass external network restriction. You can use it by copying the URL below into a tab and open it just as a regular HTTP URL.
```

Note: If the page closes immediately after opening the data URL above, consider opening 500+ contentful pages before doing so. This method should work on most recent ChromeOS devices with less than 4GB RAM.
